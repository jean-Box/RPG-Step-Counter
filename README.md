# RPG Step Counter

I'll create a step counter application using Vue.js 3 that utilizes the DeviceMotion and DeviceOrientation APIs to track steps. 
This will be an elegant, Apple-inspired pedometer app with clean visuals and responsive design.

## Core Features:

    - Step counting using device motion sensors and acceleration detection
    - Real-time step count display with attractive visualization
    - Device orientation visualization showing how the user is holding their device
    - Start/pause functionality for the step counter
    - Step history tracking with basic statistics
    - Permission handling for device sensors access
    - Responsive design optimized for mobile use
    - Battery-efficient motion detection algorithm

## Design Elements:

    - Clean, minimalist interface with ample white space and clear hierarchy
    - Soft color palette with primary blue (#3B82F6), accent green (#10B981), and neutral tones
    - Smooth animations for step counting and orientation changes
    - Large, readable typography with proper contrast ratios
    - Circular progress indicator for visual step counting feedback
    - Subtle 3D effects for device orientation visualization
    - Responsive layout that works on all mobile devices
    - Focus on readability and usability during physical activity
